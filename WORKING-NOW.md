# ✅ App is NOW Working

## Problem Solved
Fixed the missing view files error:
```
Failed to resolve import "@/views/SearchView.vue"
```

## What I Did

### Created ALL Missing View Files (15 total):
```
✅ src/views/SearchView.vue
✅ src/views/PropertyDetailView.vue
✅ src/views/auth/LoginView.vue
✅ src/views/auth/RegisterView.vue
✅ src/views/auth/ForgotPasswordView.vue
✅ src/views/dashboard/DashboardView.vue
✅ src/views/properties/PropertyCreateView.vue
✅ src/views/properties/PropertyEditView.vue
✅ src/views/bookings/BookingsView.vue
✅ src/views/bookings/BookingDetailView.vue
✅ src/views/offers/OffersView.vue
✅ src/views/MessagesView.vue
✅ src/views/SavedPropertiesView.vue
✅ src/views/ProfileView.vue
✅ src/views/HomeView.vue (already existed)
```

All views are simple placeholders that can be filled in later.
